# About Me

Hello, my name is Sophie Smith and I am a 23 years old. I am a 2018 graduate from the University of Bath with a Bachelors of Science in Computer Science. Univeristy introduced me to programming, where I was able to begin to learn the basics of java and was able to create the amazing Dungons of Doom followed by learning the basics of Python whilst writing my final year project. I am continuing my python adventures outside of university.
