Hello, my name is Sophie Smith and I am 23 years old. I am a 2018 graduate from the University of Bath with a Bachelors of Science in Computer Science. University introduced me to programming, where I was able to begin to learn the basics of Java and Python. I am continuing my development adventures outside of university.
